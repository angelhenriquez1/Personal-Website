<p>Hi, my name is Angel. I graduated from Santa Clara University with a Bachelor of Science in Economics, emphases in Data Analytics and Mathematical Economics.</p>

<p>I am passionate about telling stories from data and have worked on 17 projects which range from a SAT and District size comparison to an Adult Obesity and Inequality analysis.</p>

<p>Behind all of my work is a passion for creating from the ground up and seeing a project grow from scratch, turning numbers into conclusions and ideas into solutions.</p>

<p>In my free time I enjoy writing code, playing video games, playing sports, and writing poems.</p>
